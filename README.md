# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project applies unsupervised machine learning (K-Means Clustering) to segment customers based on behavior and demographics. The goal is to group customers into distinct clusters to improve marketing strategies and personalization.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset includes features like:
- Annual Income
- Spending Score
- Age
- Gender

## 🔍 Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)
- Elbow Method for finding optimal `k`
- K-Means Clustering
- Cluster Visualization using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

## 📊 Visualizations
- Elbow Method Plot
- Cluster Scatter Plot
- Pairplots for cluster separation

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🚀 Output
Identified 3–5 distinct customer segments with clear business insights.

## 📂 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
